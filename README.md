# AtcCoin

This is the full Windows compile of AtcCoin (ATCC (ATC)).

It was compiled from the source at [NovaExchange's Github repository](https://github.com/novaexchange/ATCC). 

No changes have been made to the code other than adding Window's dependencies in the qt-pro file, and some nodes were added to net.cpp (which do not work anyway).

This means "**setgenerate**" is left untouched which will be flagged as a virus. **IRC** is also untouched, which is also likely to be flagged. These are **false positives**.

To connect to the network make an AtcCoin.conf. See the sample [here](https://github.com/insaneinthemembrane/AtcCoin/blob/master/AtcCoin.conf). Start AtcCoin-qt, the quit it. Search for %appdata% on your computer. There will be a folder called AtcCoin. Simply copy the AtcCoin.conf there. Then restart the qt.

# Download wallet

**The wallet is available [here](https://github.com/insaneinthemembrane/AtcCoin/blob/master/release/atccoin-qt.zip)**.


# AtcCoin on Nova

AtcCoin is being delisted from the new Nova Exchange, but until then it can be found trading [here](https://novaexchange.com/market/BTC_ATCC/).

# AtcCoin is a pile of crap

AtcCoin is probably a Wallet Builders coin, or from another mechanized source. It uses the same ports as Litecoin, and the splash screen and icon are Litecoin's. No wonder the original "dev" did not release a wallet. In fact, its ticker is not even ATCC, it is ATC. The premine was about 20 million, and after that blocks paid only 20 coins..

In a nutshell, AtcCoin is a shitcoin and scamcoin.
